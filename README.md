  # STRATEGY: Sort
  
  ## Description
  
  This project helps to check the difference between the times of each ordering method.
  In this case we used the methods: insert, bubble, shell, merge and quick respectively with lists of different sizes and analyzing   the speed of response of each method with each of these lists.
  ## Experiments and Results
  
  The following table of double entry will show the ordering methods and response times according to the different lists from size   10 to 10000
  
  |Size|Insert Sort/s|Bubble Sort/s|Shell Sort/s|Merge Sort/s|Quick Sort/s|
  |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
  |10|0|0|0|0|0|
  |100|0|0|0|0|0|
  |1000|0|0.016|0|0|0|
  |10000|0.234|0.327|0|0|0.078|
  |100000|19.61|32.343|0.015|0.031|4.961|

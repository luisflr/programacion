  ## Experiments and Results
  
  The following table of double entry will show the ordering methods and response times according to the different lists from size   10 to 10000
  
  |Size|Insert Sort|Bubble Sort|Shell Sort|Merge Sort|Quick Sort|
  |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
  |10|0|0|0|0|0|
  |100|0|0|0|0|0|
  |1000|3|3|0|0|1|
  |10000|210|350|1|4|75|
  |100000|19964|33819|13|36|5911|
